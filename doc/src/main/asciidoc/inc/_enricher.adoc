= Enrichers

Enriching is the complementary concept to <<generators, Generators>>. Whereas Generators are used to create and customize Docker images, Enrichers are use to create and customize Kubernetes and OpenShift resource objects.

There are a lot of similarities to Generators:

* Each Enricher has a unique name.
* Enrichers are looked up automatically from the plugin dependencies and there is a set of default enrichers delivered with this plugin.
* Enrichers are configured the same ways as generators

The <<generator-example,Generator example>> is a good bluebprint, simply replace `<generator>` with `<enricher>`. The configuration is structural identical:

.Enricher configuration
[cols="2,6"]
|===
| Element | Description

| `<includes>`
| Contains one ore more `<include>` elements with enricher names which should be included. If given, only this list of enrichers are included in this order. The enrichers from every active profile are included, too. However the enrichers listed here are moved to the front of the list, so that they are called first. Use the profile `raw` if you want to explicitly set the complete list of enrichers.

| `<excludes>`
| Holds one or more `<exclude>` elements with enricher names to exclude. This means all the detected enrichers are used except the ones mentioned in this section.

| `<config>`
| Configuration for all enrichers. Each enricher supports a specific set of configuration values as described in its documentation. The subelements of this section are enricher names. E.g. for enricher `f8-service`, the sub-element is called `<f8-service>`. This element then holds the specific enricher configuration like `<name>` for the service name. Configuration coming from profiles are merged into this config, but not overriding the configuration specified here.
|===

This plugin comes with a set of default enrichers. In addition custom enrichers can be easily added by providing implementation of the <<enricher-api, Enricher API>> and adding these as a dependency to the build.

[[enrichers-default]]
== Default Enrichers

fabric8-maven-plugin comes with a set of enrichers which are enabled by default. There are two categories of default enrichers:

* *Standard Enrichers* are used to add default resource object when they are missing or add common metadata extracted from the given build information
* *Fabric8 Enrichers* are specific to the https://fabric8.io[fabric8 Microservice's platform]. It adds icon annotations which are visible in the fabric8 console or connections to the Continous Deliverys systems like Jenkins or Gogs.

[[f8-karaf-health-check]]
==== f8-karaf-health-check

This enricher adds kubernetes readiness and liveness probes with Apache Karaf. This requires that
 `fabric8-karaf-checks` has been enabled in the Karaf startup features.

The enricher will use the following settings by default:

- port = `8181`
- scheme = `HTTP`

and use paths `/readiness-check` for readiness check and `/health-check` for liveness check.

These options cannot be configured.

[[f8-prometheus]]
==== f8-prometheus

This enricher adds Prometheus annotation like:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: List
items:
- apiVersion: v1
  kind: Service
  metadata:
    annotations:
      prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
      prometheus.io/port: 9779
----

By default the enricher inspects the images' BuildConfiguration and add the annotations if the port 9779 is listed.
You can force the plugin to add annotations by setting enricher's config ```prometheusPort```

[[f8-spring-boot-health-check]]
==== f8-spring-boot-health-check

This enricher adds kubernetes readiness and liveness probes with Spring Boot. This requires the following dependency
 has been enabled in Spring Boot

[source,xml]
   <dependency>
     <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
     <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
   </dependency>

The enricher will try to discover the settings from the `application.properties` / `application.yaml` Spring Boot
 configuration file.

The port number is read from the `management.port` option, and will use the default value of `8080`
The scheme will use HTTPS if `server.ssl.key-store` option is in use, and fallback to use `HTTP` otherwise.

These values can be configured by the enricher in the `fabric8-maven-plugin` configuration as shown below:
[source,xml]
      <plugin>
        <groupId>io.fabric8</groupId>
        <artifactId>fabric8-maven-plugin</artifactId>

 has been enabled in WildFly Swarm

[source,xml]
   <dependency>
     <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
     <artifactId>monitor</artifactId>
   </dependency>

The enricher will use the following settings by default:

- port = `8080`
- scheme = `HTTP`
- path = `/health`

These values can be configured by the enricher in the `fabric8-maven-plugin` configuration as shown below:
[source,xml]
      <plugin>

          </enricher>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>


[[f8-vertx-health-check]]
==== f8-vertx-health-check

This enricher adds kubernetes readiness and liveness probes with Eclipse Vert.x. The readiness probe lets Kubernetes
detects when the application is ready, while the liveness probe allows Kubernetes to verify that the application is
still alive.

By default, this enricher use the same URL for liveness and readiness probes. But the readiness path can be explicitly
configured to use different paths.

The probes are added if the projects uses the Vert.x Maven Plugin or depends on the `io.vertx:vertx-core` artifact
**and** the path is explicitly configured.

The enricher will use the following settings by default:

- port = `8080`
- scheme = `HTTP`
- path = _none_ (disabled)
- readiness path = same as the path by default

To enable the health checks, configure the probed path using:

* the `vertx.health.path` project properties (`<vertx.health.path>/ping</vertx.health.path>`)
* the `path` in the `fabric8-maven-plugin` configuration:

[source, xml]
<plugin>
    <groupId>io.fabric8</groupId>
    <artifactId>fabric8-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>3.3.0</version>
    <executions>
    <execution>
    <id>fmp</id>
    <goals>
      <goal>resource</goal>
      <goal>helm</goal>
      <goal>build</goal>
    </goals>
    </execution>
    </executions>
    <configuration>
    <enricher>
    <config>
      <vertx-health-check>
        <path>/health</path>
      </vertx-health-check>
    </config>
    </enricher>
    </configuration>
</plugin>



These path, port and scheme can be configured by the enricher in the `fabric8-maven-plugin` configuration as shown below:

[source,xml]
  <plugin>
    <groupId>io.fabric8</groupId>
    <artifactId>fabric8-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>3.3.0</version>
    <executions>
      <execution>
        <id>fmp</id>
        <goals>
          <goal>resource</goal>
          <goal>helm</goal>
          <goal>build</goal>
        </goals>
      </execution>
    </executions>
    <configuration>
      <enricher>
        <config>
          <vertx-health-check>
            <port>4444</port>
            <scheme>HTTPS</scheme>
            <path>/ping</path>
            <readiness>/ping</readiness>
          </vertx-health-check>
        </config>
      </enricher>
    </configuration>
  </plugin>


Alternatively, you can use project's properties to configure the health checks:

* `vertx.health.port` - the port, 8080 by default, a negative number disables the health check
* `vertx.health.path` - the path, an empty (non null) value disables the health check.
* `vertx.health.readiness.path` - the path used for the readiness probe, an empty (non null) value disables the readiness
check. If not set it uses the regular path.
* `vertx.health.scheme` - the scheme, HTTP by default, can be set to HTTPS (adjusts the port accordingly)

By playing with the `vertx.health.path` and ``vertx.health.readiness.path` properties (and also the `<path>` and
`<readiness`> values in the configuration), you can enables or disables the check individually:

*  `vertx.health.path` not set => the health checks are disabled
*  `vertx.health.path` set to "" (empty) and `vertx.health.readiness.path` set to "/ping => the liveness check is disabled,
 the readiness check uses `GET localhost:8080/ping`
*  `vertx.health.path` set to "/ping" and `vertx.health.readiness.path` set to "" (empty) => the readiness check is
disabled, the liveness check uses `GET localhost:8080/ping`
*  `vertx.health.path` set to "/ping" and `vertx.health.readiness.path` set to "/ready"  => the readiness check uses
`GET localhost:8080/ready` , the liveness check uses the `GET localhost:8080/ping`
