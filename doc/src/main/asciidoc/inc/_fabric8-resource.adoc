=== Labels and Annotations

Labels and annotations can be easily added to any resource object. This is best explained by an example.

----
<1> `<labels>` section with `<resources>` contains labels which should be applied to objects of various kinds
<2> Within `<all>` labels which should be applied to *every* object can be specified
<3> `<service>` labels are used to label services
<4> `<replicaSet>` labels are for replica set and replication controller
<5> `<pod>` holds lables for pod specifications in replication controller, replica sets and deployments
<6> `<deployment>` is for labels on deployments (kubernetes) and deployment configs (openshift)
<7> The subelements are also available for specifying annotations.

Labels and annotations can be specified in free form as a map. In this map the element name is the name of the label or annotation respectively, whereas the content is the value to set.

The following subelements are possible for `<labels>` and `<annotations>` :

| Element | Description

| *all*
| All entries specified in the `<all>` sections are applied to all resource objects created. This also implies build object like image stream and build configs which are create implicitely for an <<build-openshift, OpenShift build>>.

| *deployment*
| Labels and annotations applied to `Deployment` (for Kubernetes) and `DeploymentConfig` (for OpenShift) objects


| *pod*
| Labels and annotations applied pod specification as used in `ReplicationController`,  `ReplicaSets`, `Deployments` and `DeploymentConfigs` objects.
