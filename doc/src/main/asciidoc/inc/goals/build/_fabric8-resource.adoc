[[resource-labels-annotations]]
=== Labels and Annotations

Labels and annotations can be easily added to any resource object. This is best explained by an example.

----
<1> `<labels>` section with `<resources>` contains labels which should be applied to objects of various kinds
<2> Within `<all>` labels which should be applied to *every* object can be specified
<3> `<service>` labels are used to label services
<4> `<replicaSet>` labels are for replica set and replication controller
<5> `<pod>` holds lables for pod specifications in replication controller, replica sets and deployments
<6> `<deployment>` is for labels on deployments (kubernetes) and deployment configs (openshift)
<7> The subelements are also available for specifying annotations.

Labels and annotations can be specified in free form as a map. In this map the element name is the name of the label or annotation respectively, whereas the content is the value to set.

The following subelements are possible for `<labels>` and `<annotations>` :

.Label and annotation configuration
[cols="1,6"]
|===
| Element | Description

| *all*
| All entries specified in the `<all>` sections are applied to all resource objects created. This also implies build object like image stream and build configs which are create implicitely for an <<build-openshift, OpenShift build>>.

| *deployment*
| Labels and annotations applied to `Deployment` (for Kubernetes) and `DeploymentConfig` (for OpenShift) objects


| *pod*
| Labels and annotations applied pod specification as used in `ReplicationController`,  `ReplicaSets`, `Deployments` and `DeploymentConfigs` objects.


| *replicaSet*
| Labels and annotations applied to `ReplicaSet` and `ReplicationController` objects.

| *service*
| Labels and annotations applied to `Service` objects.

[[resource-secrets]]
=== Secrets


Once you've configured some docker registry credentials into `~/.m2/setting.xml`, as explained in the
<<authentication, Authentication>> section, you can create Kubernetes secrets from a server declaration.

**XML configuration**


You can create a secret using xml configuration in the `pom.xml` file. It should contain the following fields:

[cols="1,1,6"]
|===
|key |required |description

|**dockerServerId**
|true
|the server id which is configured in
`~/.m2/setting.xml`

|**name**
|true
|this will be used as name of the kubernetes secret resource

|**namespace**
|false
|the secret resource will be applied to the specific
namespace, if provided
|===

This is best explained by an example.

.Example for XML configuration

[source,xml]
----
<properties>
    <docker.registry>docker.io</docker.registry>
</properties>
...
<configuration>
    <resources>
        <secrets>
            <secret>
                <dockerServerId>${docker.registry}</dockerServerId>
                <name>mydockerkey</name>
            </secret>
        </secrets>
    </resources>
</configuration>
----

**Yaml fragment with annotation**


You can create a secret using a yaml fragment. You can reference the docker server id with an annotation
`maven.fabric8.io/dockerServerId`. The yaml fragment file should be put under
the `src/main/fabric8/` folder.

.Example

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mydockerkey
  namespace: default
  annotations:
    maven.fabric8.io/dockerServerId: ${docker.registry}
type: kubernetes.io/dockercfg

[[resource-validation]]
=== Resource Validation
Resource goal also validates the generated resource descriptors using API specification of https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/master/api/openapi-spec/swagger.json[Kubernetes] and https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/origin/master/api/swagger-spec/openshift-openapi-spec.json[OpenShift].

.Validation Configuration
[cols="1,6,1"]
|===
| Configuration | Description | Default

| *fabric8.skipResourceValidation*
| If value is set to `true` then resource validation is skipped. This may be useful if resource validation is getting failed due to some reason but still you want to continue the deployment.
| false

| *fabric8.failOnValidationError*
| If value is set to `true` then any validation error will block the plugin execution. A warning will be printed otherwise.
| false

| *fabric8.build.switchToDeployment*
| If value is set to `true` then fabric8-maven-plugin would switch to Deployments rather than DeploymentConfig when not using ImageStreams on Openshift.
| false

| *fabric8.openshift.trimImageInContainerSpec*
| If value is set to `true` then it would set the container image reference to "", this is done to handle weird behavior of Openshift 3.7 in which subsequent rollouts lead to ImagePullErr
| false
|===

[[resource-route-geneartion]]
=== Route Generation

If you hit fabric8:resource goal, it will also generate route along with service for OpenShift. If you do not want to generate route.yml, you can do the same using the below configuration.

.Route Generation Configuration
[cols="1.6.1"]
|===
| Configuration | Description | Default

| *fabric8.openshift.generateRoute*
| If value is set to 'false' then it will not generate the route.yml file. By default it is set to 'true', which will create route.yml and also add resource route in openshift.yml.
| true
|===

If you do not want to generate route.yml and want to configure it in pom.xml then you can do the same using following configuration in pom.xml

.Example for not generating route resource by configuring it in pom.xml

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>io.fabric8</groupId>
    <artifactId>fabric8-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>{version}</version>
    <configuration>
        <generateRoute>false</generateRoute>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

If you are using resource fragments, then also you can configure it in service.yml. You need to add a label `expose` in the metadata of the service and need to set it false.

.Example for not generating route resource by configuring it in resource fragments

[source.yaml]
----
metadata:
  annotations:
    api.service.kubernetes.io/path: /hello
  labels:
    expose: "false"
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
----

In case both the label in the resource fragment and also the flag is set then precedence will be given to flag. Like you have set the label to true and flag to false then it will not generate route.yml because flag is set to false.

| *fabric8.openshift.enableAutomaticTrigger*
| If the value is set to `false` then automatic deployments would be disabled.
| true
|===
