== *fabric8:helm*

IMPORTANT: This goal is deprecated and might vanish in version 4.0 of this plugin. It's not yet decided whether we fix this goal for 4.0 or drop it. Please raise your voice if you want to keep it. Even better, if you want to support this goal, we are always looking for contributions ;-)

This goal is for creating https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/charts.md#the-chart-file-structure[Helm charts] for your Maven project so that you can install, update or delete your app in Kubernetes using https://github.com/kubernetes/helm[Helm].

For creating a Helm chart you simply call `fabric8:helm` goal on the command line:

[source, sh]
----
mvn fabric8:resource fabric8:helm
----

The `fabric8:resource` goal is required to create the resource descriptors which are included in the Helm chart. If you have already built the resource then you can ommit this goal.

The configuration happens in a `<helm>` section within the plugin's configuration:

.Example Helm configuration
[source, xml]
----
<plugin>
  <configuration>
    <helm>
      <chart>Jenkins</chart>
      <keywords>ci,cd,server</keywords>
    </helm>
    ...
  </configuration>
</plugin>
----

This configuration section know the following subelements in order to configure your Helm chart.

.Helm configuration
[cols="1,5,1"]
|===
| Element | Description | Property

| *chart*
| The Chart name, which is `${project.artifactId}` if not given.
| `fabric8.helm.chart`

| *type*
| For which platform to generate the chart. By default this is `kubernetes`, but can be also `openshift` for using OpenShift specific resources in the chart. _Please note that there is no OpenShift support yet for charts, so this is experimental_. You can also add both values as a comma separated list.
| `fabric8.helm.type`

| *sourceDir*
| Where to find the resource descriptors generated with `fabric8:resource`. By default this is `${basedir}/target/classes/META-INF/fabric8`, which is also the output directory used by `fabric8:resource`.
| `fabric8.helm.sourceDir`

| *outputDir*
| Where to create the the Helm chart, which is `${basedir}/target/fabric8/helm` by default for Kubernetes (and `${basedir}/target/fabric8/helmshift` for OpenShift).
| `fabric8.helm.outputDir`

| *keywords*
| Comma separated list of keywords to add to the chart
|

| *engine*
| The template engine to use
|

| *chartExtension*
| The Helm chart file extension, default value is `tar.gz`
| `fabric8.helm.chartExtension`
|
|===


In a next step you can install this via the https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/releases[helm command line tool] as follows:

[source, sh]
----
helm install target/fabric8/helm/kubernetes
----

To add the `helm` goal to your project so that it is automatically executed just add the `helm` goal to the `executions` section of the `fabric8-maven-plugin` section of your `pom.xml`.

.Add helm goal
[source, xml, indent=0]
----
<plugin>
  <groupId>io.fabric8</groupId>
  <artifactId>fabric8-maven-plugin</artifactId>

  <!-- ... -->

  <executions>
    <execution>
      <goals>
        <goal>resource</goal>
        <goal>helm</goal>
        <goal>build</goal>
        <goal>deploy</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
----

In addition this goal will also create a tar-archive below `${basedir}/target` which contains the chart with its template. This tar is added as an aritfact with classifier `helm` to the build (`helmshift` for the OpenShift mode).
