= Goals Overview

This plugin supports a rich set for providing a smooth Java developer experience. These goals can be categorized in multiple groups:

* <<goals-build, Build goals>> are all about creating and managing Kubernetes and OpenShift build artifacts like Docker images or S2I builds.

* <<goals-develop, Development goals>> target help not only in deploying resource descriptors to the development cluster but also to manage the lifecycle of the development cluster as well.

[[goals-build]]
.Build Goals
[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Goal | Description

| *<<fabric8:build>>*
| Build images

| *<<fabric8:push>>*
| Push images to a registry

| *<<fabric8:resource>>*
| Create Kubernetes or OpenShift resource descriptors

| *<<fabric8:apply>>*
| Apply resources to a running cluster

| *<<fabric8:resource-apply>>*
| Run `fabric8:resource` âžœ `fabric8:apply`
|===

[[goals-develop]]
.Development Goals
[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Goal | Description

| *<<fabric8:deploy>>*
| Deploy resources decriptors to a cluster after creating them and building the app. Same as <<fabric8:run>> except that it runs in the backgorund.

| *<<fabric8:undeploy>>*
| Undeploy and remove resources decriptors from a cluster.

| *<<fabric8:watch>>*
| Watch for file changes and perform rebuilds and redeployments

| *<<fabric8:log>>*
| Show the logs of the running application

| *<<fabric8:debug>>*
| Enable remote debugging

Depending on whether the OpenShift or Kubernetes operational mode is used, the workflow and the performed actions differs :

.Workflows
[cols="1,4,4"]
|===
| Use Case | Kubernetes | OpenShift

| Build
a| `fabric8:build` `fabric8:push`

* Creates a image against an exposed Docker daemon (with a `docker.tar`)
* Pushes the image to a registry which is then referenced from the configuration

a| `fabric8:build`

* Creates or uses a `BuildConfig`
* Creates or uses an `ImageStream` which can be referenced by the deployment descriptors in a `DeploymenConfig`
* Starts an OpenShift build with a `docker.tar` as input


| Deploy
a| `fabric8:deploy`

* Applies a Kubernetes resource descriptor to cluster

a| `fabric8:deploy`

* Applies an OpenShift resource descriptor to a cluster
