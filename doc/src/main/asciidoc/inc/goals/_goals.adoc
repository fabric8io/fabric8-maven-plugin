= Goals Overview

This plugin supports a rich set for providing a smooth Java developer experience. These goals can categorized in multiple groups:

* <<goals-build, Build goals>> are all about creating and managing Kubernetes and OpenShift build artifacts like Docker images or S2I builds.

* <<goals-develop, Development goals>> target help not only in deploying resource descriptors to the development cluster but also to manage the lifecycle of the development cluster as well.

* <<goals-infra, Infrastructure goals>> are good for setting up your Kubernetes and OpenShift development environment as well for adding this plugin to your `pom.xml`.

* <<goals-internal, Internal goals>> are used by fabric8 project to maintain meta data of the supported applications but might be useful for other uses cases, too.

| *<<fabric8:watch-spring-boot>>*
| Watch for local code changes in Spring Boot apps and restart the container on the fly

| *<<fabric8:log>>*
| Show the logs of the running application

| *<<fabric8:debug>>*

| *<<fabric8:cluster-start>>*
| Start a development cluster

| *<<fabric8:cluster-stop>>*
| Stop a development cluster

| *<<fabric8:install>>*
| Install a development cluster (via gofabric8) along with client side tools (kubectl, oc)

[[goals-internal]]
.Internal Goals

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Goal | Description

| *<<fabric8:import>>*

|===

Depending on whether the OpenShift or Kubernetes operational mode is used, the workflow and the performed actions differs :

.Workflows
[cols="1,4,4"]
|===
| Use Case | Kubernetes | OpenShift

| Build
a| `fabric8:build` `fabric8:push`

* Creates a image against an exposed Docker daemon (with a `docker.tar`)
* Pushes the image to a registry which is then referenced from the configuration

a| `fabric8:build`

* Creates or uses a `BuildConfig`
* Creates or uses an `ImageStream` which can be referenced by the deployment descriptors in a `DeploymenConfig`
* Starts an OpenShift build with a `docker.tar` as input


| Deploy
a| `fabric8:deploy`

* Applies a Kubernetes resource descriptor to cluster

a| `fabric8:deploy`

* Applies an OpenShift resource descriptor to a cluster
