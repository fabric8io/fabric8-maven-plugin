== *fabric8:watch-spring-boot*

This goal performs the following actions:

* deploys your application with Spring Boot DevTools enabled
* tails the log of the latest running pod for your application
* watches the local development build of your Spring Boot based application and then triggers a reload of the application when there are changes

You can try it on any spring boot application via:

[source, sh]
----
mvn fabric8:watch-spring-boot
----

Once the goal starts up the spring boot RemoteSpringApplication it will watch for local development changes.

e.g. if you edit the java code of your app and then build it via something like this:

[source, sh]
----
mvn package
----

You should see your app reload on the fly in the shell running the <<fabric8:watch-spring-boot>> goal!

There is also support for LiveReload as well.
